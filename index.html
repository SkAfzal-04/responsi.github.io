            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Up until 1976, under the Indian constitution, school education was a
                state subject; states possessed
                full jurisdiction over making and implementing education policies. After the 42nd Amendment of the
                Constitution of India was passed in 1976, education fell under the concurrent list.[8] This allowed the
                central government to recommend education policies and programmes, even if state governments continued
                to wield extensive autonomy in implementing these programmes.[8] In a country as large as India, now
                with 28 states and eight union territories.

                Agency instead.

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The Indian Certificate of Secondary Education (ICSE) is an examination
                conducted by the Council for the Indian School Certificate Examinations, a private board designed to
                provide an examination in a course of general education, in accordance with the recommendations of the
                New Education Policy 1986 (India), through the medium of English.[1][2] The examination allows secure
                suitable representations of responsible schools (which are affiliated to it) in their states or
                territories. The National Admissions and Accreditation agency of the UK, UCAS (Universities and College
                Admission Services) recognizes ICSE at par with the Higher School qualification of University of
                Scotland.
